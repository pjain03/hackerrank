The Problem: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/travel-around-the-world/problem
Backhistory: I worked on this one earlier this summer before taking my algorithms class. Lets see if I can apply what I learnt to this.

Started out with a very naive basic solution. 
Timed out on basically everything. O(N^2) time.

Looks to be a Dynamic Programming problem of sorts. 

I wonder if we even need to compare every city to every other...
0. diff = a - b for all a, b pairs.
1. Store all values in diff < 0 since those are the only ones which would cause potential problems.
2. Pick every one for which diff < 0 and go backwards marking each as invalid? reducing our count of valid cities?
